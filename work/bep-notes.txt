Suggestions for future
-----------

* Consider moving cannonical-tags to > Hugo taxonomies and in general use Hugo taxonomies for "indexing content". Also see Hugo's Related Content feature.
* Use Hugo leaf bundles for tutorials; shared resources (YAML files, images) between languages, simpler maintainance etc.
* Redirects from aliases
* A strategy for translations of UI vs content
